Act 1, Scene 1

SCENE I. Verona. A public place. 

    Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers 

SAMPSON

    Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals. 

GREGORY 

    No, for then we should be colliers. 

SAMPSON 

    I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw. 

GREGORY 

    Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar. 

SAMPSON 

    I strike quickly, being moved. 

GREGORY 

    But thou art not quickly moved to strike. 

SAMPSON 

    A dog of the house of Montague moves me. 

GREGORY 

    To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: 
    therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away. 

SAMPSON 

    A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will 
    take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's. 

GREGORY 

    That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes 
    to the wall. 

SAMPSON 

    True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, 
    are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push 
    Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids 
    to the wall. 

GREGORY 

    The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. 

SAMPSON 

    'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I 
    have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the 
    maids, and cut off their heads. 

GREGORY 

    The heads of the maids? 

SAMPSON 

    Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; 
    take it in what sense thou wilt. 

GREGORY 

    They must take it in sense that feel it. 

SAMPSON 

    Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and 
    'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh. 

GREGORY 

    'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou 
    hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes 
    two of the house of the Montagues. 

SAMPSON 

    My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee. 

GREGORY 

    How! turn thy back and run? 

SAMPSON 

    Fear me not. 

GREGORY 

    No, marry; I fear thee! 

SAMPSON 

    Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. 

GREGORY 

    I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as 
    they list. 

SAMPSON 

    Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; 
    which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it. 

    Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR 

ABRAHAM 

    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? 

SAMPSON 

    I do bite my thumb, sir. 

ABRAHAM 

    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? 

SAMPSON

    [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say 
    ay? 

GREGORY 

    No. 

SAMPSON 

    No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I 
    bite my thumb, sir. 

GREGORY 

    Do you quarrel, sir? 

ABRAHAM 

    Quarrel sir! no, sir. 

SAMPSON 

    If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you. 

ABRAHAM 

    No better. 

SAMPSON 

    Well, sir. 

GREGORY 

    Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen. 

SAMPSON 

    Yes, better, sir. 

ABRAHAM 

    You lie. 

SAMPSON 

    Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow. 

    They fight 

    Enter BENVOLIO 

BENVOLIO 

    Part, fools! 
    Put up your swords; you know not what you do. 

    Beats down their swords 

    Enter TYBALT 

TYBALT 

    What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? 
    Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death. 

BENVOLIO 

    I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword, 
    Or manage it to part these men with me. 

TYBALT 

    What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word, 
    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee: 
    Have at thee, coward! 

    They fight 

    Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs 

First Citizen 

    Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down! 
    Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues! 

    Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET 

CAPULET 

    What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! 

LADY CAPULET 

    A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword? 

CAPULET 

    My sword, I say! Old Montague is come, 
    And flourishes his blade in spite of me. 

    Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE 

MONTAGUE 

    Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
